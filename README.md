Yahoo! KeyKey
===
[Yahoo! Keykey](http://tw.media.yahoo.com/keykey/) is a customized Chinese input methods tool based on an open source project [Openvanilla](http://openvanilla.org/). The project had been officially aborted since 15th January, 2013. However, Yahoo! had decided to make Yahoo! KeyKey a open source projecet under new BSD Licene. Although it was originally hosted as [KeyKey](https://github.com/Yi-Kai/KeyKey), it is no longer maintained. This repo aims to update towards latest operating systems and provide a comprehensive overview to build the installer.

##Installation on Mac OSX

The installer disk image cannot be directly opened or downloaded. However, together with the whole repository, it can be done in no time.

1. In Terminal, run the following command to make a copy of the repo. If you don't know where terminal is, simply type 'Terminal' on Spotlight (^ + Space).
   
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/kctong529/YahooKeyKey.git
   ```

2. The location of the repo copy depends on your previous step. If you have no idea about it, run this command and you'll be fine with it.

   ```
   $ open ./
   ```

3. Open `YahooKeyKey-OSX-Leopard-1.1.2535.dmg` in the repo root directory.
4. Open `Install Yahoo! KeyKey.app` and run through the installer.
